# Project import/export

>**Notes:**
>
>  - [Introduced][ce-3050] in GitLab 8.9.
>  - Importing will not be possible if the import instance version is lower
>    than that of the exporter.
>  - For existing installations, the project import option has to be enabled in
>    application settings (`/admin/application_settings`) under 'Import sources'.
>    You will have to be an administrator to enable and use the import functionality.
>  - You can find some useful raketasks if you are an administrator in the
>    [import_export](../../../administration/raketasks/project_import_export.md)
>    raketask.
>  - The exports are stored in a temporary [shared directory][tmp] and are deleted
>    every 24 hours by a specific worker.

## Exporting a project and its data

1. Go to the project settings page by clicking on **Edit Project**:

    ![Project settings button](img/settings_edit_button.png)

1. Scroll down to find the **Export project** button:

    ![Export button](img/import_export_export_button.png)

1. Once the export is generated, you should receive an e-mail with a link to
   download the file:

    ![Email download link](img/import_export_mail_link.png)

1. Alternatively, you can come back to the project settings and download the
   file from there, or generate a new export. Once the file available, the page
   should show the **Download export** button:

    ![Download export](img/import_export_download_export.png)

## Importing the project

1. The new GitLab project import feature is at the far right of the import
   options when creating a New Project. Make sure you are in the right namespace
   and you have entered a project name. Click on **GitLab export**:

    ![New project](img/import_export_new_project.png)

1. You can see where the project will be imported to. You can now select file
   exported previously:

    ![Select file](img/import_export_select_file.png)

1. Click on **Import project** to begin importing. Your newly imported project
   page will appear soon.
