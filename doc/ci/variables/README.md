## Variables

When receiving a build from GitLab CI, the runner prepares the build environment.
It starts by setting a list of **predefined variables** (Environment Variables) and a list of **user-defined variables**

The variables can be overwritten. They take precedence over each other in this order:
1. Trigger variables
1. Secure variables
1. YAML-defined job-level variables
1. YAML-defined global variables
1. Predefined variables

For example, if you define:
1. `API_TOKEN=SECURE` as Secure Variable
1. `API_TOKEN=YAML` as YAML-defined variable

The `API_TOKEN` will take the Secure Variable value: `SECURE`.

### YAML-defined variables
**This feature requires GitLab Runner 0.5.0 or higher and GitLab CI 7.14 or higher **

GitLab CI allows you to add to `.gitlab-ci.yml` variables that are set in build environment.
The variables are stored in repository and are meant to store non-sensitive project configuration, ie. RAILS_ENV or DATABASE_URL.

```yaml
variables:
  DATABASE_URL: "postgres://postgres@postgres/my_database"
```

These variables can be later used in all executed commands and scripts.

The YAML-defined variables are also set to all created service containers, thus allowing to fine tune them.

Variables can be defined at a global level, but also at a job level.

More information about Docker integration can be found in [Using Docker Images](../docker/using_docker_images.md).

### User-defined variables (Secure Variables)
**This feature requires GitLab Runner 0.4.0 or higher**

GitLab CI allows you to define per-project **Secure Variables** that are set in
the build environment.
The secure variables are stored out of the repository (the `.gitlab-ci.yml`).
The variables are securely passed to GitLab Runner and are available in the
build environment.
It's desired method to use them for storing passwords, secret keys or whatever
you want.

**The value of the variable can be shown in build log if explicitly asked to do so.**
If your project is public or internal you can make the builds private.

Secure Variables can added by going to `Project > Variables > Add Variable`.

They will be available for all subsequent builds.

### Use variables
The variables are set as environment variables in build environment and are accessible with normal methods that are used to access such variables.
In most cases the **bash** is used to execute build script.
To access variables (predefined and user-defined) in bash environment, prefix the variable name with `$`:
```
job_name:
  script:
    - echo $CI_BUILD_ID
```

You can also list all environment variables with `export` command,
but be aware that this will also expose value of all **Secure Variables** in build log:
```
job_name:
  script:
    - export
```
